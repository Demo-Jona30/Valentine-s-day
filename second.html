            This picture could speak a thousand words, thoughts and emotions.
            This is the day it all began for us, after church at that coffee shop.
            I had just told you that I have feelings for you and you asked for time and let me tell you Hunn, I've never been that stressed in my life for those two weeks. 
            But I'm blessed and thankful that I waited for the girl that would light up my entire life.
            This day it all began.

            This day is really important cause it marks another step in our relationship, the day we kissed. 
Thank you for trusting me and letting me in so I could see and experience what an amazing person you are.
From the beginning till now, I've been blessed to love you more and more each day.
We've grown so much to miss each other so much.

            The Road Trip!!
This day was the most amazing and equally stressing day for me. 
But I do have to say that my girlfriend handled it in the best way possible.
We got the key locked with the car and thank God dad was there at home. We got the key and went met Sandeep and Sera for the first time, went home and cuddled for sometime. You taught me how to dance and gave up cause I would do my own steps.
I dropped you home and we texted the whole day and never thought twice.
THIS DAY WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY FOR SURE!!!

            As days passed by, we grew together and this month we had our 6 months and I'd imagine no one I'd rather be than with you. You've made me so much wiser and responsible, taught me how to love and how to mature. 
In the time gap, You've come home multiple times and we've spent countless hours talking, laughing, irritating, annoying, cuddling, loving and taking care of each other. I can not wait for more and here's to a life time with you, my Love.
This picture I chose because of "pfff obviously we're the cutest". 
But in all seriousness we are!!!
No one can take that away

            How do I even start about this day, Babyy.
I can not even comprehend the day.
But you my love have never stopped to amaze me every single day and this day especially you out did yourself. 
Travelling 27kms for me is just something I can not comprehend.
But you pulled it off very good and Im proud of you.
You've made my year, month, day, hour, min, second of my life worth while.
You always make me feel worth it and loved.
